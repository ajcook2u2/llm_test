prompt = "While I agree that the moral thing to do is to have a right to be forgotten, the use of the word ‘right’ has some interesting connotations. " \
         "Data that is collected today can and will be used in the future in ways we cannot currently foresee. Data de-anonymizing is a good example of this. Therefore it would make ssense on that alone to instinctually say that people everywhere should have a unalienable right to have their data removed full stop. After all when someone gives over property, it doesn’t evolve over time and become more useful." \
         "Except it does. At least in some edge cases. And it's the edge cases that are the problem with this line of thinking. Firstly, goods do evolve in their utility over time with the emergence of technology. For example, many prized commodities now, such as oil, silicon, and lithium; where all near useless historically. Another thing is that not every single piece of data is gathered at scale by large corporations. Google, a for profit company that uses automated data recovery systems, easily comes to mind with a right to be forgotten. But what about other players in this space? For example, a cancer research firm. If participants choose to give their data, that could involve costly investment on the part of collection. If participants had the choice of removing their data should further developments change their mind, the firm could lose thousands if not millions just to recoup comparable data to resume their research. Enshrining this as a right ignores these edge cases." \
         "A better remedy would be to have better, more understandable terms for users to consent to on a case by case basis to restore nuance to this discussion. And these principles should be applied evenly, they don’t change based on geography." \
